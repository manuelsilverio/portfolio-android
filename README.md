## Easy Feeds and Easy weather: 2014

* Two of my first Apps to be published in GooglePlay. Back in the day of Eclipse and Java. Back then, there was barely anything asynchronous. However, these apps worked perfectly for the time they were live.
* Unfortunately my GooglePlay account got cancel due to accumulating strikes from naming decisions on several Apps which I used to learn about publishing. I did not manage to republish them as they were more a means for me to improve my skills.
